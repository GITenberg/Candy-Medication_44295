PREFACE.


CANDY MEDICATION has given such delightful results in practice among
children that the author believes it should be more widely known
and used. A formulary to serve as the common meeting ground for the
prescribing physician and the dispensing pharmacist seems absolutely
necessary to make this form of medication more generally available; and
it is mainly to supply this formulary that this little book has been
published.

Researches conducted by the author in the Pharmacologic Laboratory of
the University of Illinois during the past five years, as well as the
experience gained by the use of this form of medication in private
practice, form the basis of this publication.

To give the best results, the sweet tablets described in this formulary
should be freshly prepared on physician's order; thereby securing
efficiency and palatability to the highest degree, and enabling
the physician to prescribe the dose and combination needed for the
particular case in hand. To bring these tablets into the category of
extemporaneous preparations, the author has elaborated the process of
"fat covering" which makes the preparation of these tablets no more
difficult than the making of pills or of suppositories.

In the pages that precede the formulary, an attempt has been made to
present the principles that have been used in the elaboration of the
formulae, so that formulae for other medicaments suitable to this form
of administration may be developed.

Concise directions on the care and use of the tablet machine have been
included, to enable any pharmacist equipped with an inexpensive tablet
machine to prepare these tablets without difficulty.

The author is keenly aware of the fact that there are probably still
some imperfections in the formulae given herein; though he has
spared neither time nor labor in making them as perfect as possible.
Therefore, comments and criticisms, as well as suggestions, are most
welcome, and will receive careful consideration.

It is the author's hope that this booklet may be instrumental in
robbing childhood of one of its terrors, namely, nasty medicine; that
it may lessen the difficulties experienced by nurse and mother in
giving medicament to the sick child; and help to make the doctor more
popular with the little ones.

CANDY MEDICATION




CHAPTER I.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.


THE IDEA of presenting medicine in candy form is really very old.
The term confection, which originally meant a medicinal compound
being derived from the Latin word "_conficere_," to put together, has
been applied since the days of classical antiquity to mixtures of
medicinal substances with saccharine matter. The only official relics
of this once very extensive class of preparations are the confection
of rose and the confection of senna; both of which, however, are
also practically obsolete. The reason for this is not difficult to
find. Neither of them come up to our modern ideas of a confection.
We may officially call them a confection, but a youngster would be
disrespectful enough to disagree with the pharmacopoeia.

More closely akin to candy are lozenges, and yet they are not real
candy. The only one among them that is pleasant is the santonin
lozenge; and it is the only one that is popular. An especially good
imitation of candy form are the deservedly popular so-called German
worm lozenges. It was acquaintance with these that led the writer to
seek for other real candy medicaments. He could find only two such upon
the market: viz., Calomel Tablets under the name of "Aromatic Calomel,"
and Phenolphthalein Tablets under various fanciful trade-names, such
as "Purgen," "Phenolax," etc., unless "Candy Cathartic Cascarets,"
and the French candy laxative known as "Tamar Indien" were also to be
included.

       *       *       *       *       *

Convinced that administration in candy form would be ideal for
children, the author took a number of years ago a course of instruction
with a candy-maker, in the hope of finding in the confectioner's art
some new form of pleasant administration for medicine. He made sulphur
taffy and cod-liver oil chocolate creams;[1] but these and a large
number of other attempts were unsuccessful. It may be of interest,
in this connection, to note that, in 1911, Sir James Sawyer[2]
published in "The Lancet" a process for the production of what he
calls "cremulae" or medicated chocolate creams. They were prepared by
evaporating a mixture of sugar and of milk to the consistency of paste,
in which various medicaments might be incorporated, and which is then
covered with chocolate, as in the popular chocolate drop. This is, as
will be seen, a troublesome process. The author's studies in the candy
shop seemed to point to "fondant" as the most suitable candy form for
purposes of medication. "Fondant", however, has the disadvantage of
becoming hard with age. Free from this objection and closely similar
to the "fondant" is a rather lightly compressed tablet made of finely
powdered cane sugar. And so finally the tablet form was chosen as
the best and most convenient for candy medication--a form which was
already in successful use, as has been stated, for the administration
of calomel and of phenolphthalein. For such tablets the term _tabellae
dulces_,[3] or sweet tablets, might be proposed.




CHAPTER II.

TABELLAE DULCES.


TO BE SUCCESSFUL, sweet tablets must meet the following requirements:

1. They must be perfectly delicious sweets, attractive in form, color,
and odor; and free from the slightest suspicion of disagreeable or
medicinal taste.

2. They must disintegrate rapidly in the mouth; for a sick child will
usually not suck candy as a healthy youngster would.

3. To constitute a real advance in therapeutics, it must be possible
for the average pharmacist to prepare them extemporaneously, so that
the physician may be able to fit the medicament to suit the case,
and that the pharmacist may not be forced to carry in stock a large
assortment of these more or less perishable goods.

In view of these exacting requirements, it may seem remarkable
that over fifty different medicaments are at present available for
administration in the form of sweet tablets. This has been accomplished
by taking advantage of the fact that some medicines are practically
tasteless; that modern synthetic chemistry has enriched our resources
in this direction by the production of a large number of tasteless,
or almost tasteless, and yet active substances; and that many of the
isolated active principles of drugs are easily disguised. In some
cases a chemical trick is successful, e. g., using a little alkali
or a little acid to render the substance less soluble in the mouth.
Some of the bitterest alkaloids, e.g., strychnine, have been rendered
available for candy medication by the use of finely powdered fuller's
earth, or of Lloyd's Reagent, to be described later. Quite a number of
almost insoluble substances of slight but lingering taste can be made
perfectly pleasant by saccharinization.




CHAPTER III.

THE USES OF SWEET TABLETS.


IT MAY seem strange that modern pharmacy which boasts of so many
elegant and palatable preparations suitable for adults, has thus far
done so little to render medicine more acceptable to children; and yet
attractiveness and palatability are even more important for the little
ones than for the grown-ups. Syrups have hitherto been our chief aids
in making medicines more pleasant for children. Unfortunately, however,
many a child has had its palate offended by liquid medicines to such
a degree that it abhors spoon-medicine of any kind, and will struggle
even against the most palatable. When one witnesses the struggling
of the average child against the average medicine, one cannot but
wonder whether at times the struggle does not do more harm than the
medicine can do good, and wish that we had other means of administering
medicines to the little ones. As all children love candy, this would
seem the form most desirable for them. For one who has not used candy
medication there is a revelation in store in the positive enjoyment
and eagerness with which children take these sweet tablets. And many
a petted child that has grown up into a sensitive woman, who believes
she cannot swallow a pill, also cannot and will not take medicine. It
so happens that just these are often excessively fond of candy and
will take candy medicine. Another use for candy medication is in the
treatment of the insane, who frequently will not take medicine, but may
take it in candy form.

    _In Myxedema:_
        Thyroid.

Of course, a large variety of combinations of these could be elaborated.

It, therefore, seems established that we have, in candy medication,
a method of fairly extensive applicability; an almost complete
therapeutic armamentarium of the greatest possible value in the
treatment of children. For the tiny infant this method is, of course,
unsuitable as well as unnecessary. As soon, however, as the youngster
commences to know what candy is, it is ready for candy medication. It
is particularly during the ages of from three to ten that this form of
administration is indicated.

Several objections have been raised against this method. Perhaps the
most serious one lies in the danger of poisoning, from the fact that
children enjoy these tablets so much that they are likely to eat a
large number of them at one time, should the mother be careless enough
to leave them within reach. The only way to prevent such an occurrence
is not to prescribe more tablets than would constitute a safe dose
should all of them be taken at one time. It is better to have the
patient get a new supply daily than to have a single case of death or
serious disturbance occur from this source.

Another objection that has been raised is that the dose of some of the
medicines is very small. In the case of such remedies as sulphur and
chalk the author admits that the dose is perhaps too small to be of
practical importance. In the case of most other medicaments, however,
the smallness of dose is of advantage rather than of disadvantage,
in that it necessitates administration at short intervals. If the
administration of small doses frequently repeated until the desired
effect is obtained is a good principle in practice, it is particularly
so in pediatrics. For are not all the vital processes of the child much
more rapid than those of the adult; are not its bowel movements, its
urinations more frequent, does it not need nourishment more often? Then
why not medicine?




CHAPTER IV.

THE MAKING OF SWEET TABLETS.


IT IS GENERALLY supposed that tablet making is an art, requiring
special expertness and expensive machinery. Now while both of these
ideas are correct when the preparation of a large variety of tablets
and of large quantities is contemplated, they are erroneous in regard
to the making of prescription quantities of these sweet tablets, which
present a comparatively simple and relatively uniform problem in tablet
making.

Though the process of making moulded tablets was introduced by Dr.
Robert M. Fuller of New York before the Academy of Medicine on February
21, 1878, in a paper entitled: "Dose-Dispensing Simplified,"[4] the
simplification was evidently not such that druggists could notice it;
for moulded tablets have not become popular among them, perhaps mainly
because they require drying. Likewise are compressed tablets, which
were introduced even earlier by Professor Brockeden of England in 1844,
considered unsuitable for extemporaneous preparation, as granulation
of the powder by moistening is believed to be necessary; and this, of
course, also requires drying.

A step in the direction of rendering tablet making available for
extemporaneous preparation was made in 1909 by A. Schleimer[5] by
advocating the use of cacao butter in lieu of granulation of the
powder and subsequent drying. This brings tablets into the category
of extemporaneous preparations. All that is necessary is to add three
percent of cacao butter to the powder, and it is ready for immediate
compression in a tablet machine. Having found that cacao butter is
liable to become rancid on keeping of some tablets made with it, the
author experimented to find a substitute devoid of this tendency, and
found it in paraffin of low melting point.[6] For tablets that are
not to be kept for any length of time, cacao butter is preferable, as
it melts readily and is digestible. The amount of paraffin, however,
that enters into the composition of each tablet is so small that in
spite of its indigestibility, it seems that it could not meet with any
but theoretic objection. Either of these materials, in form of fine
shavings, is added to the extent of three to five per cent. with just
sufficient trituration to distribute fairly well. Excessive trituration
lessens the efficiency of the lubricating agent. If the tablet has a
tendency to stick to the punches, the material can be worked better if
a little talcum, say three per cent. is added to the powder by stirring
it in with a spatula rather than by trituration. This process renders
tablet making no more difficult or time-consuming than the making of
pills or capsules.

       *       *       *       *       *

The author has succeeded in still further simplifying the process by
the preparation of what he would propose to call "fat sugar." Having
noticed that the addition of, say, 10 per cent. of powdered cacao to
sugar forms an almost ideal powder for immediate compression in the
tablet machine, the idea occurred to him to reproduce, as nearly as
possible, the physical condition of cacao by covering each particle of
powdered starch with a thin layer of fat, which can readily be done by
triturating starch with liquid petrolatum. While other fat, such as
cacao butter, "Crisco" or paraffin, might be used for this purpose, by
dissolving the fat in ether and thus distributing it over the starch,
permitting the ether subsequently to evaporate, the author has found
that liquid petrolatum, 1 part, distributed over 3 parts of starch
forms a powder which added to sugar in proportion of about twenty
per cent. renders it admirably suitable for compression in a tablet
machine. The starch might be sweetened by previously triturating it
with an alcoholic solution of saccharin and permitting the alcohol to
evaporate; though this sweetening is not essential. For starch, thus
prepared, the author proposes the name "fat starch", the formula for
which will be found in Chapter VIII. Sugars containing twenty per cent.
of "fat starch", are ready for immediate compression in the tablet
machine; and admit of admixture of a moderate amount of medicament
without losing this quality. If a large amount of medicament is to
be incorporated, then an additional amount of "fat starch" should
be allowed. Sugars containing "fat starch" the author has called
"fat sugars" for want of a better name. He is aware of the fact that
petrolatum is not a fat in the true sense of the word. Nevertheless
it is, no doubt, its "fatty" nature that does the work; other fatty
substances, such as cacao butter or "Crisco", producing the same result
as far as rendering the powder suitable for compression in the tablet
machine is concerned. Liquid petrolatum has the advantage over these of
being devoid of tendency to rancidity.

Excessive trituration interferes with the efficiency of the fat starch,
evidently by distributing the fat all over the powder, rendering it
homogeneous, which is inimical to tablet making. Therefore in case of
the red fat sugar which is used as a vehicle for poisonous medicaments
that require very thorough trituration, it is recommended that the fat
starch be added after the trituration.

The author would suggest that the pharmacist prepare the various fat
sugars described in Chapter VIII and that he keep them on hand, in
a cool and _dark_ place, adding the medicament as prescribed by the
physician, making use of Chapter VII for guidance in the elaboration of
individual formulae.




CHAPTER V.

THE TABLET MACHINE.


THE GROUNDLESSNESS of the second objection to tablet making by retail
druggists, namely, the necessity of possessing expensive machinery, can
perhaps best be shown by the illustrations here given. The simplest
and yet practical form of tablet machine known to the author is the
"No. 25" machine of Whitall-Tatum Company of Philadelphia (Fig. 1). The
price of this machine is about ten dollars.

Its chief disadvantage is that it works rather slowly, as the powder
must be put into the die by hand with a small tool furnished with the
machine. An automatically feeding machine of reasonable price is the
"Eureka" Hand Tablet Machine, furnished by the F. J. Stokes Co., of
Philadelphia (Fig. 2). This machine may also be obtained for motor
power.

Detailed directions for the putting up and the use of these machines
seem unnecessary here as they accompany the machine when sent out by
the manufacturer. A few points on the care of the tablet machine may,
however, be brought out in order to save the novice trouble and mishaps.

All compressing machines for tablet making consist essentially of a die
and two punches, an upper and a lower. It is important that these be
kept scrupulously clean and free from rust, nicks and scratches; for
unless these parts be perfectly smooth it is impossible to get them to
work properly. When not in use, they should be kept completely covered
with vaselin or else immersed in liquid petrolatum, in order to protect
them against rust. When required for use, the grease is removed from
them as completely as possible by means of a soft cloth.

[Illustration: Fig. 1

A simple yet practical form of tablet machine.]

In putting the die and punches into the machine, it is best to put in
the lower punch first, making sure that it has been pushed completely
down into its socket. Then put in the die, so that the top of the die
be exactly flush all around with the table of the machine. See to it
that the face of the lower punch be exactly flush with the top of the
die when the punch is at its highest point. Then insert the upper punch
in its socket; and let it enter the die before locking it in place, so
as to insure perfect alignment.

[Illustration: Fig. 2.

The Eureka Hand Tablet Machine. An automatically feeding machine of
reasonable price.]

When die and punches are to be removed, take out the upper punch first,
then the lower punch and die, which may come out suddenly and be
injured by knocking against the upper punch if the latter be still in
place.

When particles of the powder stick to the die or punches, they should
not be scraped off with a hard instrument, as this is liable to
scratch, but should be wiped off with a soft, slightly moistened
cloth. To prevent sticking, a little talcum may be used, sprinkled over
the powder and lightly mixed by stirring with a spatula.

When the upper face of the tablet splits off, we speak of "capping."
To overcome this, ten per cent. of fat starch may be added to the
powder. Should "capping" still occur, the amount of fat starch might be
increased. "Capping" may also be due to the use of excessive pressure.
It may furthermore be due to die or punches being worn or damaged. When
this has occurred, the best thing to do is to get a new set of punches,
or to have the damaged one refinished by an expert mechanic, preferably
the makers of the tablet machine.

It would lead us beyond the scope of this work to give detailed
directions for making tablets of all kinds. A pharmacist who has
equipped himself with a tablet machine and has developed the ambition
to make a general line of tablets[7] may be referred to Mr. Joseph R.
Wood's book[8] on this subject.




CHAPTER VI.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF FORMULAE FOR SWEET TABLETS.


Choice of Flavor.

THERE are quite a number of medicines sufficiently free from taste
and odor to be made perfectly pleasant by the mere admixture of sugar
and of flavoring. These can, of course, be prepared with any flavor
desired. In the formulary, rose has been chosen as the flavor under
these circumstances, but any other flavor may be used instead.

Substances that have a slightly acrid taste are generally best
disguised by peppermint. For sour taste, lemon is best. Wintergreen was
chosen as the flavor for salicylates.

Substances that have a slightly bitter taste are best disguised by
"vanilla cacao sugar." For drugs that, in addition to a slightly bitter
taste, have an odor that needs disguising, "cinnamon cacao sugar" is to
be preferred.


The Subduing of Tastes.

There are quite a number of drugs that have a tendency to leave a
rather persistent disagreeable after-taste, drugs of slight solubility,
particles of which remain on the tongue longer than the sugar
does, so that their taste lingers after the taste of the sugar has
disappeared. For such drugs saccharinization solves the problem of
candy medication. The saccharin will be most efficient, as the author
has shown by repeated experiments, if it is directly incorporated with
the drug in solution rather than in dry form. Saccharinization is,
therefore, carried out in the formulary by triturating the drug with a
saturated (3 per cent.) alcoholic solution of saccharin, and permitting
the alcohol to evaporate subsequently. The drying may be expedited by
using a hot mortar. When alcohol is not permissible, as in the case
of "Alcresta" preparations (see below), dry saccharinization must be
used instead, that is, triturating the drug with saccharin, preferably
a 1 to 10 trituration. Likewise when time does not permit moist
saccharinization, triturating the substance with a somewhat larger
amount of saccharin will answer the purpose.

A second expedient for the subduing of taste is fat covering, which
consists of triturating the drug with liquid petrolatum or other fat,
e. g., Crisco in ether, and permitting the ether to evaporate. The thin
film of fat left on the drug delays its solution to a slight degree,
yet sufficiently to reduce the taste, so that certain drugs--such
as aspirin, digitalis, diuretin--can be administered in the form of
sweet tablets in useful dose. In these cases, saccharinization and fat
covering combined give the best results.

       *       *       *       *       *

Most of the alkaloids can be administered in candy form by
saccharinization with or without additional fat covering, and, in the
case of some, the addition of sodium bicarbonate is still further
useful in lessening the solubility, thereby subduing the taste. Only
in the case of the bitterest alkaloids such as strychnine and of
alkaloids that have to be given in large doses such as quinine are
different expedients necessary. For quinine, aristochin or saloquinine
solve the problem. For strychnine, Lloyd's "Alcresta" strychnine gives
good results. In 1910, John Uri Lloyd[9] of Cincinnati discovered
that the addition of fuller's earth to alkaloids almost completely
abolished their bitter taste. He found on further research that this
activity resided in the finest particles, especially those of colloidal
dimensions, which could be separated from the coarser portion of
fuller's earth by elutriation. By means of this powder, now known as
Lloyd's Reagent, it is possible to obtain the bitterest alkaloids, even
strychnine, in almost tasteless form. That this strychnine combination
is still active, can be proved by the fact that it will kill a dog
almost as readily as the uncombined strychnine. Lloyd has coined the
name "Alcresta" for these alkaloidal combinations; they are marketed
by Ely Lilly and Company. The combination of the strychnine with
fuller's earth is destroyed by alkali and by alcohol. Hence alcohol
must not be added to the powder after the Alcresta combination has been
incorporated. The addition of a little acid lessens the bitterness of
the combination by lessening solubility in the mouth. The addition of
acid is also of advantage to lessen the solubility in the saliva, and
with it the taste, of such resinous bodies as the resin of podophyllum.


Choice of Color.

To indicate tablets containing poisonous substances, a dark red color
is chosen, unless cacao disguises the taste better. It would be
advisable not to prescribe more than a small number of such tablets
to be dispensed at one time, so as to prevent the possibility of
poisoning. The choice of the other colors has been more or less
without special principle underlying it, yellow having been chosen for
lemon, and green for wintergreen, leaving pink for rose and white for
peppermint. The relation of color to flavor can, of course, be varied.




CHAPTER VII.

FORMULAE FOR THE PREPARATION OF SWEET TABLETS


The subjoined formulae are published to serve for guidance in the
preparation of sweet tablets and as a basis for further study and
improvement.

The doses given are children's doses, none of them exceeding a dose
safe for a child three years of age. Most of the tablets carry as large
a dose as can well be given in this way; which in some cases, though
not in many, is not sufficient for a three-year-old child. Where a
larger dose can easily be disguised in the same manner, this fact is
noted in connection with the formulae.

A warning may not be amiss, in this connection, not to put up in this
form anything that does not result in a faultlessly pleasant, actually
delicious candy. For confidence once lost is not easily restored.

Formulae for the preparation of the stock sugars referred to in this
formulary will be found in Chapter VIII. They can all be prepared
extemporaneously. The drying necessary after the addition of coloring
may be expedited by the use of a warm mortar. Nevertheless, alternate
formulae have been inserted in most instances to facilitate rapid
extemporaneous compounding, in case the stock sugar be not at hand.

While most of these tablets keep well, a few deteriorate. In any case,
the freshly prepared tablet will be found more pleasant than one that
has become stale by being kept in stock.

Should difficulty be experienced in the compression of some of these
tablets, the addition of a little shaved paraffin by gentle trituration
in a mortar; or the stirring in of a little talcum powder with a
spatula; or both measures combined will probably overcome the trouble.
Some powders work best with light pressure; others require rather heavy
pressure.

on "Phenacetine" is not actually in the text but the page referenced
has "Acetphenetidin." Instead of trying to sort out what the author or
editor meant, these entries are retained as printed.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
